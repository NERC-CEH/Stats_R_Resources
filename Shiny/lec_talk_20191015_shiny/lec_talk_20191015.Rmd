# What is `shiny`?

--

- R package from RStudio
> .fancy["A simple, in-browser, markdown-driven slideshow tool targeted at people who know their way around HTML and CSS"]

- Web application framework for R

- R code â†’ interactive web page

- No HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge required

- Great for sharing R analysis with someone scared of R (and others)


---

# Why sharing your work interactively using web apps/dashboards?

--

- Let the user explore the datset themselves (Guided tour)


- Let the user try out your methods (e.g. using their own dataset)


- Illustrate impact and engage stakeholders


- Python equivalent? [Dash by plotly](https://plot.ly/dash/)


---

# Today's goal:

???

Awkwardly, this seems to work! (to hide or exclude sldie "exclude: true")

- Showcase a few R shiny apps (a flavour of what they can do)

# What's in a `shiny` app?

.shrink[
.right[![Right-aligned image](img/Capture5.PNG)] ]

- plus optional web elements (e.g. static images, css files)

---
# Two ways to run a `shiny` app

- single file option
.shrink[
.shrink[
.right[![Right-aligned image](img/Capture.PNG)] ]]

- two file option - save UI as "ui.R" and server as "server.R" in the same directory

.shrink[
.right[![Right-aligned image](img/Capture2.PNG)] ]]

---
# Making your `shiny` app available

- Run it locally

- Serve it on http://www.shinyapps.io/

- Use other servers: Amazon Cloud, your institution etc.

---
# UI components

- inputs (e.g. buttons, sliders, checkboxes, file upload box) ...`input$*`

- outputs (e.g. plots, tables)

- layouts (how do you want everything to be arranged) and HTML

- check out the package `shinythemes`

.shrink[
.right[![Right-aligned image](img/Capture6.PNG)] ]

---
# UI components

- everything is turned into HTML + JavaScript for you (it's just a webpage)

```{r eval=FALSE}
sliderInput("num","Choose a number", min = 0, max=100, value = 20)
```

.shrink[
.right[![Right-aligned image](img/Capture3.PNG)] ]

---
# Server components 

- your analysis (does it react to user input?) 

- If so, use `reactive` (assign), `observe` (access), `isoluate`

- output components...`output$*`, use `render*( {} )`

---
# Reactivity

- Shiny uses reactive programming and supports reactive variables

- Unlike regular R, if `x` changes, anything that relies of `x` is re-evaluated.

- Not limited to R figure types

- It will take time to write the .js file

# How to design your `shiny` app?

--
Things to think about:

- what is your audience? 

- What data/ data product would you like them to interact with?
--

- what would you like them to change (i.e. inputs)?

- what would you like to show them (i.e. outputs)?
--

- how to fit your analysis behind the scene (i.e. in server.R)

--

- how would you like the different elements appear (e.g. layout)?
